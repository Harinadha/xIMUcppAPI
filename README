xIMUcppAPI is a bridge between original C# 'xIMU API 13.1' and native C/C++ , visual C++ MFC. You can use 'xIMUcppAPI' in any C or C++ or Visual C++ MFC projects.
Basically 'xIMUcppAPI' is a C++/CLI wrapper around original 'xIMU API' written in C#.

There is a article at the following URL which explains how it was done.
